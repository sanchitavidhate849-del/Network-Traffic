# Wireshark Network Traffic Capture & Analysis

## **Objective**
Capture live network packets using Wireshark and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

## **Tools Required**
- **Wireshark** (Free, available at [https://www.wireshark.org](https://www.wireshark.org))

## **Steps Performed**
1. **Install Wireshark**  
   - Download and install the latest version from the official website.

2. **Start Capturing on Active Network Interface**  
   - Open Wireshark and select the network interface currently in use (e.g., Wi-Fi, Ethernet).

3. **Generate Network Traffic**  
   - Browse websites (e.g., Wikipedia, Google).  
   - Optionally, use online ping tools to simulate ICMP traffic.

4. **Stop Capture After 1 Minute**  
   - Click the red square “Stop” button in Wireshark after enough traffic has been generated.

5. **Filter Captured Packets by Protocol**  
   - Use filters such as:  
     - `http` (HTTP traffic)  
     - `dns` (Domain Name System queries)  
     - `tcp` (Transmission Control Protocol)

6. **Identify At Least 3 Different Protocols**  
   - Common examples: HTTP, DNS, TCP, HTTPS, ICMP.

7. **Export Capture as `.pcap` File**  
   - File → Export Specified Packets → Save as `.pcap`.

8. **Summarize Findings**  
   - Document identified protocols and example packets.

## **Outcome**
By completing this exercise, you will:
- Gain **hands-on experience** with Wireshark.
- Learn how to identify common network protocols.
- Develop basic **packet analysis skills** and **protocol awareness**.
