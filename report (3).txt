Network Traffic Analysis Report
=================================
Objective:
Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

Tools Used:
- Wireshark (free, open-source network protocol analyzer)

Summary of Process:
1. Installed Wireshark.
2. Started capturing packets on the active network interface (Wi-Fi/Ethernet).
3. Generated network traffic by browsing websites and performing online searches.
4. Stopped capture after ~1 minute.
5. Filtered packets by specific protocols (HTTP, DNS, TCP, TLS, UDP).
6. Identified multiple protocols from the capture.

Protocols Identified:
- DNS (Domain Name System): Used for translating domain names into IP addresses.
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Connection-oriented protocol for reliable data transfer.
- TLS (Transport Layer Security): Provides encryption for HTTPS traffic.
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Used for faster, connectionless communication (e.g., streaming).
- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Used for unencrypted web traffic.

Example Packet Details:
- DNS Query: example.com -> Response: IP address returned.
- TCP Connection: Client port 53214 to server port 443 (HTTPS).
- TLS Handshake: Exchange of certificates for encryption setup.

Outcome:
Hands-on packet analysis experience, with improved understanding of how different protocols operate in real network communication.
